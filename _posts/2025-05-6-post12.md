### What Is Dijkstra's Algorithm?
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a classic and widely used algorithm for finding the **shortest path** between a starting 
node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. Developed by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956, its 
primary purpose is to navigate a network of points, where each connection (or edge) has a specific "cost" or 
"weight" associated with it. Unlike simpler algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) which find the shortest 
path in terms of the number of edges, Dijkstra's accounts for the total weight of the path, making it ideal for 
more realistic scenarios like finding the quickest route in a road network.


### The Core Idea: Greedy Approach
At its heart, Dijkstra's Algorithm uses a **greedy approach**. This means that at each step, it always makes the 
choice that seems best at that moment. It maintains a set of visited nodes and, for every unvisited node, it keeps 
track of the shortest distance found so far from the source. The algorithm greedily selects the unvisited node 
with the smallest known distance, marks it as visited, and then inspects all its neighbors to see if a shorter 
path to them can be found through this newly visited node.


### How It Works: Key Components
To implement its strategy, the algorithm uses a few key data structures:
* A **distances map** (or array) to store the shortest distance from the source to every other node. This is initialized to infinity for all nodes except the source, which is 0.
* A **set of visited nodes** to keep track of the nodes for which the shortest path has already been finalized.
* A **priority queue** to efficiently determine the next unvisited node with the smallest distance. The priority queue is crucial for making the algorithm fast, as it allows for quick retrieval of the minimum-distance node.


### The Algorithm Step-by-Step üó∫Ô∏è
The process unfolds as follows:
1.  **Initialization**: Set the distance to the source node as 0 and all other nodes to infinity. Add the source node to the priority queue.
2.  **Loop**: While the priority queue is not empty, extract the node with the smallest distance. Let's call it `u`.
3.  **Visit**: If `u` has already been visited, skip it. Otherwise, mark `u` as visited.
4.  **Relax Edges**: For each neighbor `v` of `u`, calculate the distance to `v` through `u` (distance to `u` + weight of edge `u-v`). If this new distance is shorter than the currently known distance to `v`, update it and add `v` to the priority queue with its new, shorter distance.
The loop continues until all reachable nodes have been visited.


### A Simple Example
Imagine a graph where you want to find the shortest path from node A to node C. Let's say there's a path A ‚Üí B (weight 1) and B ‚Üí C (weight 2), for a total weight of 3. There is also a direct path A ‚Üí C (weight 5).
1.  Dijkstra's starts at A (distance 0).
2.  It explores A's neighbors. It finds a path to B with a cost of 1 and a path to C with a cost of 5.
3.  The next closest node is B (cost 1), so it moves there.
4.  From B, it explores its neighbors and finds a path to C with a cost of (cost to B) + (cost B‚ÜíC) = 1 + 2 = 3.
5.  Since 3 is less than the previously known cost of 5 to reach C, it updates the shortest path to C to be 3.


### Important Limitation: Negative Weights
A crucial limitation of Dijkstra's Algorithm is that it **does not work correctly with graphs that have 
negative-weight edges**. The greedy nature of the algorithm finalizes the distance of a visited node, assuming it 
has found the shortest path. A negative edge encountered later could create a shorter path to a node that has 
already been marked as visited, a possibility that Dijkstra's does not account for. For graphs with negative 
weights, other algorithms like the Bellman-Ford algorithm must be used instead.


### Real-World Applications üåç
Dijkstra's Algorithm is fundamental to modern technology and logistics. Its most famous application is in 
**network routing protocols**; GPS devices and mapping services like Google Maps use it (or a variation of it, 
like A*) to find the fastest route between two locations. It's also used in telecommunications to find the optimal 
path for data packets to travel across a network and in social networking to find the shortest degree of 
separation between two people.
