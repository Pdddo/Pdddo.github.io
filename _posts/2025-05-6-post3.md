_Activity Selection Problem Example_

### What Is the Activity Selection Problem?
The Activity Selection Problem is a classic optimization challenge that deals with scheduling. Imagine you have a 
list of activities, each with a specific start time and finish time, and you want to participate in as many of 
them as possible. The catch is that you can only do one activity at a time. The goal is to select the maximum 
number of non-overlapping activities from the given list. This problem is a great example of how a simple, elegant 
strategy can lead to an optimal solution.


### The Core of the Problem: Scheduling Conflicts

The main challenge lies in managing **scheduling conflicts**. If you select one activity, you automatically 
disqualify all other activities that overlap with its time slot. For instance, if you choose an activity that runs 
from 9 AM to 11 AM, you cannot select any other activity that starts before 11 AM. The question then becomes: what 
is the best strategy for picking activities to ensure you leave as much time as possible available for future 
choices? This is where a greedy approach comes into play.


### The Winning Strategy: A Greedy Choice
The most effective way to solve the Activity Selection Problem is by using a **greedy algorithm**. A greedy 
algorithm, at each step, makes the choice that seems most beneficial at that moment without considering the 
future. For this particular problem, the winning greedy strategy is to **always choose the activity that finishes first**. By selecting the activity that ends the earliest, you free up your time as quickly as possible, thereby 
maximizing the opportunity to fit in subsequent activities.


### The Algorithm Step-by-Step üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The algorithm is remarkably simple and efficient. Here's how it works:
1.  **Sort**: First, sort all the activities based on their **finish times** in ascending order.
2.  **Select**: Choose the very first activity in the sorted list. This is always your first optimal choice since it finishes the earliest.
3.  **Iterate**: Go through the rest of the sorted list. For each activity, check if its start time is on or after the finish time of the last activity you selected.
4.  **Add**: If there is no overlap, select this new activity and update it as the "last selected activity."
Continue this process until you have checked every activity.

_Contoh Soal_

### Solution Steps using a Greedy Algorithm
1. Sort the activities by their finish times in ascending order:
(1,4), (3,5), (0,6), (5,7), (8,9), (5,9)

2. Select the first activity that finishes the earliest: (1,4)

3. Select the next activity that starts after the previously selected activity finishes:
- Skip (3,5) because it starts before (1,4) finishes
- Skip (0,6) because it overlaps
- Select (5,7) because it starts after (1,4) finishes
- Select (8,9) because it starts after (5,7) finishes
- Skip (5,9) because it overlaps with (5,7)

### Final Result
The selected activities are:
(1,4), (5,7), and (8,9)

The maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be done is 3.

### Why Does This Greedy Strategy Work?
The strategy of picking the activity that finishes earliest is proven to be optimal. By choosing it, you are not 
only making a safe, non-conflicting choice, but you are also maximizing the remaining time resource. Any other 
choice would involve an activity that finishes later, which could only reduce the amount of time available for 
other potential activities. This simple choice at each step intuitively leads to the best overall outcome.


### Real-World Applications üìÖ

Te Activity Selection Problem is not just an academic puzzle. It serves as a model for many real-world scheduling 
scenarios. It can be used for scheduling meeting rooms in an office to maximize the number of meetings held. It's 
also applicable in industrial processes for scheduling tasks on a single machine to maximize throughput. Any 
situation where you have a single resource (a person, a room, a machine) and a list of time-bound tasks that need 
to use it can be modeled and optimized using this efficient greedy approach.
