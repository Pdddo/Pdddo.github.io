### What is Topological Sorting?
Before diving into Kahn's Algorithm, it's essential to first understand the problem it solves: **topological sorting**. 
Imagine you have a list of tasks where some tasks must be completed before others. For example, you must put on 
your socks before your shoes. A topological sort is simply an ordering of these tasks that respects all these 
dependencies. This concept only applies to a specific type of graph called a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, 
where "directed" means the dependencies have a one-way direction, and "acyclic" means there are no circular 
dependencies (like task A requires B, and B requires A).


### Introducing Kahn's Algorithm
Kahn's Algorithm is a popular and intuitive method for creating a topological sort of a DAG. Published by Arthur 
Kahn in 1962, it works by systematically identifying nodes that have no prerequisites and processing them. As it 
processes these nodes, it "removes" them and their corresponding dependencies from the graph, which in turn 
reveals the next set of nodes that are ready to be processed. This iterative approach is straightforward and 
provides a clear, step-by-step path to the final sorted list.


### The Core Concept: In-Degrees
The algorithm's logic is built around a key piece of information: the **in-degree** of each node. A node's 
in-degree is the count of its incoming edges. In our task analogy, this represents the number of prerequisite 
tasks a specific task has. A task with an in-degree of 0 has no prerequisites and can be performed at any time. 
These nodes are the starting points for the algorithm, as they don't depend on any other nodes in the graph.


### The Algorithm Step-by-Step üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Kahn's algorithm follows a clear, queue-based procedure. Here‚Äôs how it works:
1.  **Compute In-Degrees**: First, calculate the in-degree for every single node in the graph.
2.  **Initialize the Queue**: Create a queue and add all nodes that have an in-degree of 0.
3.  **Process the Queue**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node. Add this dequeued node to your final topological sort list.
4.  **Update Neighbors**: For the node you just dequeued, go through all of its neighbors. For each neighbor, decrement its in-degree by one (since its prerequisite has now been completed).
5.  **Add New Nodes**: If decrementing a neighbor's in-degree causes it to become 0, add that neighbor to the queue.
This process continues until the queue is empty.


### A Simple Example
Let's say you have tasks: A ‚Üí B, A ‚Üí C, B ‚Üí D, C ‚Üí D.
1.  **In-degrees**: A=0, B=1, C=1, D=2.
2.  **Queue**: Starts with **[A]** since its in-degree is 0.
3.  **Dequeue A**: Add A to the result. Result: `[A]`. Update A's neighbors (B and C). B's in-degree becomes 0, C's becomes 0. Add them to the queue. Queue: `[B, C]`.
4.  **Dequeue B**: Add B to the result. Result: `[A, B]`. Update B's neighbor (D). D's in-degree becomes 1. Queue: `[C]`.
5.  **Dequeue C**: Add C to the result. Result: `[A, B, C]`. Update C's neighbor (D). D's in-degree becomes 0. Add D to the queue. Queue: `[D]`.
6.  **Dequeue D**: Add D to the result. Result: `[A, B, C, D]`. The queue is now empty. The final sorted order is A, B, C, D.


### Handling an Impossible Task: Cycle Detection üîÑ
A major strength of Kahn's Algorithm is its natural ability to **detect cycles**. A topological sort is only 
possible on an acyclic graph. If a graph contains a cycle (e.g., A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A), the nodes within that cycle will 
never have their in-degrees reduced to 0 because they are all waiting on each other. As a result, they will never 
be added to the queue. At the end of the algorithm, if the number of nodes in your final sorted list is less than 
the total number of nodes in the graph, you can confidently conclude that the graph contains at least one cycle.


### Real-World Applications üåç
Kahn's algorithm is far more than an academic exercise; it's used to solve critical dependency problems in the real world. Common applications include:
* **Course Scheduling**: Determining the order in which university courses must be taken based on prerequisites.
* **Software Build Systems**: Compiling source code files in the correct order based on their dependencies (e.g., in tools like Maven or Make).
* **Task Management**: Scheduling tasks in project management software where certain tasks must be finished before others can begin.
* **Data Processing**: Executing steps in a data pipeline where the output of one process is the input for another.
